# Percolation

This is the first Homework; It is about utilizing Union Find Algorithm & Weighted Quick Find in specific. We use the algorithm to calculate numerically the probability *p* that can make a system percolate (any top cell connected to any bottom cell); We are required to proof the claim that *p*~=0.5931 and the homework does exactly that. The percolation symbolisis a lot of real world applications such as insulating material in a conducting material (or vise versa) or finding a connection between two persons in a large social network and so on.

# Queues

The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce usage of generics and iterators. The Assignment emphasizes the apparingly-similar yet different implementation and outcomes from implementing Stacks (LIFO) and Queues (FIFO). In general, the fastest depends on the usage, if nothing is going to crumble if the DS suddenly lagged (amortized time) then Using Arrays is the most suitable solution. If a stream must be maintained without any delay in inputing from stream, then LinkedList ensures such desire.
