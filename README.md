# Percolation

This is the first Homework; It is about utilizing Union Find Algorithm & Weighted Quick Find in specific. We use the algorithm to calculate numerically the probability *p* that can make a system percolate (any top cell connected to any bottom cell); We are required to proof the claim that *p*~=0.5931 and the homework does exactly that. The percolation symbolisis a lot of real world applications such as insulating material in a conducting material (or vise versa) or finding a connection between two persons in a large social network and so on.
